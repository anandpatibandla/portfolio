 Java Full Stack Developer


- Involved in Requirements gathering, Analysis, Design, Development and Testing of application using AGILE methodology (SCRUM) in a Test-driven Development (TDD) approach.
- Developed and implemented OOPS principles using Java11 and J2EE to enhance the scalability of web-based enterprise applications, resulting in a 40% decrease in application response time.
- Implemented the application with the HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS, AJAX, Redux, JAVA 8 features, Spring Framework, Spring Boot ,RESTful webservices, Hibernate emphasizing security through Spring Security, OAuth2.0.
- Created reusable React components, including functional and class-based components, to enhance modularity and efficiency in the application.
- Built and maintained SPAs using React Router to enable smooth navigation and state management across different views without full-page reloads.
- Utilized React’s state and props to efficiently manage and bind data retrieved from -APIs to the view, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Implemented the ReactJS lifecycle methods with the ES6+ features under class components using babel, webpack and React hooks(like ‘useState’, ‘useEffect’, ‘useContext’ etc) in functional components to manage state and side effects.
Created and configured the Redux store, defined actions, and wrote reducers to manage state changes, ensuring a centralized and predictable state management system.
- Replaced local component state with Redux for better state consistency and reduced complexity, leading to more maintainable and scalable state management.
Optimized Redux performance by implementing techniques such as memoization and efficient state updates,

##PROJECTS
Impact of AI on Market Capitalization of Companies Using Python

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a game-changer in the business world, with companies investing heavily in AI-driven technologies to improve efficiency, decision-making, and automation. However, the true impact of AI on a company’s financial performance, particularly on its market capitalization, remains an area of research and interest.

- This project aims to quantify the relationship between AI adoption and market capitalization growth using historical stock data, AI investment trends, sentiment analysis of AI-related news, and predictive modeling techniques.

- By leveraging data science and machine learning, we can analyze:

How AI-related events influence stock market movements
Which companies benefit the most from AI adoption
The correlation between AI investments and market cap growth
Predictive trends in AI-driven companies
This project will incorporate financial data analysis, sentiment analysis, time series forecasting, and AI-driven stock prediction models to derive meaningful insights.
